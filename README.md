# C Minus Compiler
 
This C Minus compiler is a simplified version of a C compiler created using Java to understand how compilers work starting from the lexical, syntactical and semantic level. I provide several code examples with some errors and correct code examples to prove the functionality of the analyzer. In the PDF file provided, there is the summary of the C Minus language rules used to create the compiler.
